                    since that seems to be the only experience on the site. 
                    Playing around with the scrollbar was secondary to that

                <p>It communicates this experience via tying graphics to the scrollbar 
                    and using big texts. As the user scrolls, the webpage itself evolves 
                    to give way to the next sections of the site. Since this is primarily 
                    a site dedicated to raise awareness of janitors of the modern world, 
                    big and simple texts are used to effectively deliver information to the user.</p>

                    Acknowledging that and because of the nature of the site, I think the 
                    experience should be interacted with once. Once the user gets to the end, 
                    there really is nothing else extra to experience, other than going back 
                    to review those same experiences again.</p>

                    The scrolling itself not offering to have the user to come back also contributes 
                    to this communication.</p>

                    gives you some sort of information that is often overlooked. In this case, 
                    janitor's jobs and importance to society is something that everyone, in the 
                    modern era, overlooks. The structure of the sections also resemble them in away: 
                    first, it introduces you to the overlooked information, then goes in depth 
                    to how important it is to be aware of. It also reminds me of those advertisements 
                    that raise awareness of an overlooked aspect of society.</p>

                <p>For this kind of site, user engagement is a must, so graphics tend to be valued 
                    quite greatly. Users tend to stay when there is something going on -- most users 
                    do not really stay on informational sites that are mostly walls of text unless 
                    they are already very interested in the content itself. These sites that raise 
                    awareness has to catch the user's attention to give the users information. How
                    phamphlets and advertisements engage the user is through visual elements
                    accompanying the information, so the site should relatively do the same.

                    cater to its intended audience with a visual style that typically
                    engages them. Some advertisements (such as bad effects of cigarettes) appeal
                    to the user by telling a story to evoke sadness and pity, which in turn
                    affects them to not consume cigarettes. In general, persuasive and informative
                    media generally appeal to the user's humanity and empathy to drive their

                    I can see it being tedious to get to some sections or see specific 
                    graphics that I wanted to see. Due to the amount of graphics
                    in the site moving, it could also be quite overwhelming
                    if the user is trying to go back and forth to re-read.

                    time in between the texts allows the user to digest the

                    the scrollbar graphic animations. It is satisfying to
