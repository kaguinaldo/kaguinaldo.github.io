    <h1 class="studentnote">Week 2</h1>
    <p style="font-style: italic">
        For this week, we are being introduced to HTML and the elements commonly
        used in the language. Since I already know most of these due to my previous
        course (Computer Science), I went on ahead to basically just copy the
        course's welcome module in Canvas. I do not know the fonts used in the
        module itself, so it'll just be Helvetica for now.

        I've already stylised this entire webpage when we're supposed to
        do it next week... whoops

            Interactive Media 1 is about enabling you to engage with the 
            fundamentals of interaction design through the use of web programming. 
            Our focus will be on building up from the basic principles of programming,
            covering the standard web languages - HTML, CSS and JavaScript, 
            in order to be able to select and use appropriate programming languages, 
            together with core concepts of interaction design, in service of your 
            broader digital design goals.

        <p>
            Upon completion of this course, you will have a comprehensive 
            understanding of the key concepts of interactivity, user experience design, 
            and information architecture in web-based environments. 
            You will also be able to identify and utilize the appropriate technologies 
            to address interactive design challenges. Furthermore, you will have the
